stone texture looks cool, either keep it or do something similar, here's how you made it:
	1. render plasma
	2. hurl noise at it, only once at about 30%?
	3. desaturate the image
	4. gaussian blur radius of 1
	5. render lava on top of that and set color to alpha so only the lines show
	6. repeat 4 a couple times, a little red looks really good, offsets the cool grey
once most of the concept part gets done, other terrain types to think about adding:
	lava
	forest floor?
	water
	cobblestone
	gravel
	path (dirt or brick)
	
multiplayer online  game rooms?
	delayed play over long periods of time?
make the random map generator better so similar terrain types are grouped together

	is a good reference, but just a reference, a lot of the stuff you can do differently
	to fit your game better
get the map loader to work for faster map work? will need some way to load maps eventually,
	I think Unity may actually take care of that though
