### hexagons

This is a prototype turn-based strategy game I made a little while ago but just never shared until now.
I didn't have rights to some of the assets so I had to strip those out, but all the code's here plus a few assets that didn't have any legal strings attached.
It is of course only a prototype, but a functional prototype and a lot of engine is implemented.  It centers around the player playing against a computer adversary by controlling a squad of units each with unique stats and abilities fighting on a field of variable-height hexagonal (thus the name) tiles.  Most of the interesting stuff code-wise you'll find in the Assets folder, I got as far as implementing turn cycles, pathfinding, camera controls, saving and loading games, saving and loading maps from a text file as a sort of rudimentary map editor, random map generation, and some basic unit interaction.
This project is from a few years ago when I was a much-less seasoned developer, so please don't copy any of the terrible design patterns or lack thereof that you see here :) but it works and it's fun!
